## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:

```
$ cd <Tic_tac_toe>
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tta2yta/Tic_tac_toe.git
```

## To run the code:

```
$ ruby main
```
## üî® Testing

To run the tests described for each method:
- change directory to the root of the project (cd into the project folder)
- from terminal run the command `rspec`
- to run a specific test `rspec ./spec/my_enumerables_spec.rb:104` (here 104 is the line number of the method)
- result should be similar to:

## Usage

- To play the game, open the terminal and direct yourself to the main folder root of TicTacToe.
- Once you are in the main root file, to run the program, enter in the terminal the command: ruby bin/main.rb
- Follow the game instructions

## Instructions

 Once the game has started
 1. The first player places their name
 2. The first player needs to select a symbol from X or Y
 3. The second player needs to enter their name
 4. Symbol for the second player is assigned automatically
 5. Game starts - Makes player1 choose a section and place his symbol (1-9)
 6. If the number you entered is already taken, you will be forced to choose again.
 7. Player 2 will now select a space in the board to place the symbol (the same rules apply as step 6)
 8. Players need to obtain a winning combo using their symbol (CHECK BELOW FOR WINNING COMBOS)
 9. If none of the players can get a winning combo, the game will simply draw with no winners. 
 10. The game will prompt you to play once again: press "Y/y". Or to end the game: press "N/n"
 11. Enjoy
